          <h2>•Elementary Years: </h2>
  
          <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My academic journey began at Davao City Special School, where I laid the foundation for 
          my education. Despite facing the challenges that often come with the elementary level, I graduated 
          with a sense of accomplishment and readiness to take on the next chapter of my learning journey.</h3>

          <h2>•High School Adventures:</h2>
  
          <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on to Daniel R. Aguinaldo National High School, I embraced the opportunities and challenges of high 
          school life. The rigorous curriculum, coupled with extracurricular activities, molded me into a 
          well-rounded individual. Graduating from Daniel R. Aguinaldo National Highschool marked a significant 
          milestone, showcasing my dedication to education and personal growth.</h3>
  
          <h2>•Senior High School Success:</h2>
  
          <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transitioning into senior high school still at Daniel R. Aguinaldo National High School, I delved 
          deeper into my academic interests. The senior high level not only provided a platform for 
          specialization but also equipped me with skills crucial for my chosen path. Graduating from senior 
          high school opened the door to higher education, leading me to the University of Southern Mindanao.</h3>
